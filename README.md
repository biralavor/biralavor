> [!NOTE]
> # Mobile app published -> Milky Shaky LAB 💫
> This is a beside project done C# from studies in C language

- 🪐 I've built and published a real-time astronomical mobile game app for kids called `Milky Shaky LAB`. ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆
- 👯 It was done in collaboration with my fellow friends: Marcos Inoue, [Guilherme Sabino](https://github.com/guilmedev), [Lucas Almeida](https://github.com/lucasrdea) >> with a help from [Alfredo Gomes](https://github.com/alfredo1995), [Nikopaah](https://github.com/nikopaah), and [Daniel Portela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-portela-725637b3/)
- 📲 You can download `Milky Shaky LAB`, it's **free** and without ads (remember: it's for kids, therefor -> no ads 🚫 no chat, but a lot of **scientific knowledge**)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due new Google Play Policy Restrictions, Milky Shaky LAB was temporarily removed from the store. It needs to be updated, but I didn't have spare time yet. I hope I'll make it!
