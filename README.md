- At [42 São Paulo](https://42sp.org.br/), I’m a Software Engineering Cadet Student
- At [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/graduacao/tecnologo/analise-e-desenvolvimento-de-sistemas/) I'm also studying another BTech Degree: Systems Engineering
- I enjoy coding in C, but [Python is increasingly capturing my aha-moments](https://github.com/biralavor/42_discovery_piscine_Python)
- At FIAP, I'm learning [JAVA - and you can check here](https://github.com/biralavor/FIAP-DomainDrivenDesign-JAVA)
- ⚡ STEM Fun fact: I have built a startup to foster curiosity on kids with STEM content 🔭 ->> [playSTEM academy](https://biralavor.github.io/playstem_academy/)

| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63623e7f-e76f-4632-9957-058286ec20bb) | **[42](https://www.42network.org/)** is the largest free IT school network in the world, with a global presence of 50+ campuses in 30+ countries. Each campus offers the same innovative pedagogy in harmony with the local culture and environment. 42’s student body is a melting pot of cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives from around the world. This unique blend of diversity fosters an environment of creativity and innovation. No other IT school offers such a wide network of campuses. I'm studying at [42 São Paulo](https://42sp.org.br/) campus. |


> [!TIP]

> As I'm exploring the fundamentals of **DevOps**, some projects have `>` as a label for:
> 
> `>` ⏩ Actions :: Github Actions implemented
> > _it runs a few services automatically, after `git push`, like: `make`, `valgrind`, `norminette`, etc..._
> 
> `>` 🚸 TDD :: Test Driven Development implemented
> > _a method to fasten literacy problem context and build stronger programs, with Unit Tests_
> 
> `>` 📐 GHprojects :: Github Projects implemented
> > _a great tool for pair programming and split multiple tasks_
> 
> `>` 🔩 TBD :: Trunk Based Development implemented
> > _every issue found turns into a new branch. When it's done, the Pull Request is merged and the branch is deleted automatically_

# Side Projects
> [!NOTE]
> # Mobile app published -> Milky Shaky LAB 💫
> This is a beside project done in C#

- 🪐 I've built and published a real-time astronomical mobile game app for kids called `Milky Shaky LAB`. ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆
- 👯 It was done in collaboration with my fellow friends: Marcos Inoue, [Guilherme Sabino](https://github.com/guilmedev), [Lucas Almeida](https://github.com/lucasrdea) >> with a help from [Alfredo Gomes](https://github.com/alfredo1995), [Nikopaah](https://github.com/nikopaah), and [Daniel Portela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-portela-725637b3/)
- 📲 You can download `Milky Shaky LAB`, it's **free** and without ads (remember: it's for kids, therefor -> no ads 🚫 no chat - just **scientific knowledge**)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due new Google Play policy restrictions, Milky Shaky LAB was temporarily shutdown from the store. It needs to be updated, but I didn't have spare time yet. I hope I'll make it!
