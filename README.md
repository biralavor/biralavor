## Mobile app -> Milky Shaky LAB 💫
- 🪐 I've built and published a real-time astronomical mobile game app for kids called `Milky Shaky LAB`. ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆
- 👯 It was done in collaboration with my fellow friends: https://github.com/guilmedev and https://github.com/lucasrdea
- 📲 You can download `Milky Shaky LAB`, it's **free** and without ads (remember: it's for kids, therefor -> no ads 🚫 no chat, but a lot of scientific knowledge)
